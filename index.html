        <h2>üìú About me</h2>
        <p>
          I come from Syria and Venezuela, in fact, I consider myself a third-culture individual who lived in several countries since I left my home country as a 17 years-old to India. I have an immense passion for storytelling as I believe in the change stories can bring. My values are deeply rooted in intercultural understanding and dialogue.        </p>

        <p>
          It was my passion to showcase the lives of individuals from the Middle East and Central Asia regions that inspired me and my three teammates to cycle for 80 days from Turkey to China crossing over 9 countries, and becoming the youngest team in the world to do so ( Please refer to our website <a href="https://www.silkroadbiking.org/" style="color: orange">The Silk Road Biking Project</a> to learn about our journey and the stories throughout).
        </p>

        <p>
          I admire the power of images, while I partook in several exhibitions in India growing up, my focus is on storytelling that tackles social justice and advocacy, from the unrest in Myanmar to menstruation taboos in Nepal to Syrian refugee women rights in Greece. 
        </p>

        <p>
          For the past couple of months, I have been focusing on creating interactive stories using data and programming by learning how to code on my own. While developing these technical skills as both a journalist and a data scientist. Currently, I am the leading individual for NU-Q's very own three-year-long research project. Where my team will be studying the shift of the sentiment towards Qatar by the public in relation to the World Cup by analyzing data mined from social media and search engines such as Google and Bing.

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41DSJx2FOIs" style="color: orange"> üé• Explainer-Video: Chhaupadi in Nepal Explained</a> : This Explainer Video highlights Chhaupadi in Nepal which is a practice where women are confined in a cattle shed, or a makeshift mud hut, also referred to as a menstruation hut, for the duration of their menstrual period. The ancient ritual comes from a the superstition that women are ‚Äúimpure‚Äù while menstruating.

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3yziCED6V8" style="color: orange"> üé• Experiment-Video: Blinking Egg:</a> : I wanted to explore the power of an image by using minimal tools to deliver a particular message. In this video, a flashlight and an egg with background music take the viewer into an emotional journey.  As someone who lived through the time when civilians in Syria during the war became their own storytellers by simply using their phones, I wanted to make a statement that it‚Äôs not the equipment that makes a story a good story, but rather the creativity of how you wish to tell this story.
